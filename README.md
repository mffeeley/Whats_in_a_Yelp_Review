<h3>Analyzing drivers of positive and negative sentiment on Yelp.</h3>

This is my fourth, NLP-based project for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.  The goal of this project is to use NLP to analyze Yelp reviews and decipher what drives positive and negative sentiment.  All data was downloaded from Yelp.com.

Three are three subfolders in this repository:

<b>Data:</b> Contains the subset of reviews used for the project, along the with the full dataset of businesses associated with the reviews.
<b>Notebooks:</b> Contains the project notebook.  The entire end-to-end process is shown in this notebook.
<b>Pickles:</b>	Contains the pickle file of the main dataframe used for the project.
